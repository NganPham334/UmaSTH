    You sleep in more than usual.  #line:0d32063 
    No deadlines. No alarms.  #line:03b06ed 
    Maybe resting at the right time is a smart choice.  #line:0d8f70c

    You spend time thinking deeply.  #line:0f8f480 
    About how you study, how you work, how you face pressure. #line:0670308 
    You feel more prepared than before  #line:077762b 

The break comes to an end.  #line:0aec2d1 
AA is still there… waiting for you to return.  #line:0ed9d34
