Blay: I wonder who is here?

// Set side char manually (updates preservation tracker to "navia")
<<side navia_shocked>>
Navia: I've been waiting for hours!

// PRESERVATION TEST:
// Navia speaks again. 
// Tracker is "navia". Speaker is "Navia". Match!
// Result: Sprite stays "navia_shocked". It does NOT revert to default "navia".
Navia: And you didn't even call!

// Set main char reaction
Blay: I'm so sorry!

// Hide side char / return to center
<<side none>>
Blay: She left...
